title Singleton

class Singleton

Singleton : {static} uniqueInstance
Singleton : // other useful Singleton data …
Singleton : {static} getInstance() : Singleton
Singleton : // other useful Singleton methods()

note right of Singleton
The uniqueInstance
class variable holds our
one and only instance
of Singleton
end note

note left of Singleton
The getInstance() method is static,
which means it’s a class method, so you
can conveniently access this method
from anywhere in your code using
Singleton getInstance(). That’s just as
easy as accessing a global variable, but
we get benefit like lazy instantiation
from the Singleton.
end note

note bottom of Singleton
A class implementing the Singleton
Pattern is more than a Singleton;
it is a purpose class with its
own set of data and methdods.
