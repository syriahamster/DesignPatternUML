title Factory Method Pattern

class Product
class Creator
class ConcreteProduct
class ConcreteCreator

Creator : factoryMethod()
Creator : anOperation()
ConcreteCreator : factoryMethod()

Creator <|– ConcreteCreator
Product <|– ConcreteProduct
ConcreteProduct <- ConcreteCreator

note top of Creator
The Creator is a class that contains
the implementation for all of the
methods to manipulate products,
except for the factory method.
end note

note right of Creator
The abstract factoryMethod()
is what all Creator subclasses
must implement.
end note

note right of ConcreteCreator
The ConcreteCreator
implements the
factoryMethod(), which is
the method that actually
produces products.
end note

note “The ConcreteCreator is responsible for\ncreating one or more concrete products. It\nis the only class that has the knowledge of\nhow to create these products.” as n1
ConcreteProduct .. n1
ConcreteCreator .. n1

note “All products must implement\nthe same interface so that the\nclasses which use the products\ncan refer to the interface,\nnot the concrete class.” as n2
n2 . ConcreteProduct
n2 . Product
